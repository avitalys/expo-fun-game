# Mobile Game with Expo, RNGE and Matter.js

This project is a game app built using [Expo](https://expo.dev/) tools, [React Native Game Engine](https://github.com/bberak/react-native-game-engine) framework , and [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/)! This project combines the power of Expo for rapid development and deployment with the physics engine Matter.js for dynamic gameplay experiences.

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for our mobile game built with Expo and Matter.js! Expo is a powerful tool that accelerates mobile app development by providing a suite of pre-configured components and a seamless development workflow. With Expo, we can rapidly build, test, and deploy our game without the need for complex native code configurations.

One of the key advantages of Expo is Expo Go, the official app for testing Expo projects on real devices. Expo Go allows users to easily preview and interact with our game during development directly on their own iOS or Android devices. This eliminates the need for cumbersome setup processes or the hassle of managing multiple emulators, streamlining the testing and debugging phases of development.

Combining Expo's ease of development with the dynamic capabilities of Matter.js, our mobile game promises to deliver an immersive gaming experience with rich visuals, engaging gameplay mechanics, and realistic physics interactions. We're excited to share our project with you and invite you to explore the repository to learn more!

## Features

- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Built with Expo, ensuring compatibility with both iOS and Android devices.
- **Dynamic Physics Engine**: Utilizes Matter.js to create realistic physics interactions and dynamic gameplay elements.
- **Easy Deployment**: Expo simplifies the deployment process, allowing for rapid iteration and updates.

## What's Next

In the future, we plan to expand this project with the following enhancements:

- **Additional Levels**: Introduce new levels with unique challenges and environments to keep players engaged.
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Improve visuals and animations to create a more immersive gaming experience.
- **Optimization**: Fine-tune performance and optimize code for smoother gameplay on a wider range of devices.
- **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects to enhance gameplay immersion and feedback.
- **Leaderboard**: Introduce a leaderboard system to track and compare players' scores globally.
- **Screen Navigation**: Implement screen navigation to enhance user experience and enable seamless transitions between game sections.
- **Personalization Settings**: Add personalization settings to allow players to customize their gaming experience, such as adjusting sound volume or enabling/disabling certain features.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to evolve and improve this mobile game!
